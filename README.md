Multi-Disease Diagnosis App (Heart, Diabetes, Parkinson’s)

Deployed App:
👉 https://multi-disease-app-vvxpb6d77ecdkevquceung.streamlit.app/

🧠 Overview

This project implements a Multi-Disease Diagnosis System capable of predicting:

Heart Disease

Diabetes

Parkinson’s Disease

using pre-trained Machine Learning models (RF, KNN, SVM).
The app provides an easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input clinical data and receive:

✔ Prediction (High Risk / Low Risk)
✔ Explanation of prediction (rule-based thresholds, LIME-ready architecture)
✔ A clean deployment on Streamlit Cloud

This project is ideal for clinical research prototypes, academic demonstrations, and healthcare ML projects.

🚀 Live App

Access the deployed app here:

👉 https://multi-disease-app-vvxpb6d77ecdkevquceung.streamlit.app/

No installation required — works in any browser.

🧩 Features
1. Multi-Disease Prediction

Select one of:

Heart Disease

Diabetes

Parkinson’s Disease

Each disease dynamically loads its own input form based on its unique clinical features.

2. Pre-trained ML Models

Models used:

Disease	Model Used	Notes
Heart Disease	Random Forest	Trained on structured tabular features
Diabetes	KNN with scaling	Pipeline: StandardScaler → KNN
Parkinson’s Disease	SVM (RBF)	Probability outputs enabled
3. Explainability (XAI)

Explanation panel after prediction

Shows feature effects based on logical clinical thresholds

Architecture prepared for LIME/SHAP integration in future deployment

Metadata JSON files included for transparency

4. Streamlit Web App

Fully cloud-hosted

Clean, responsive UI

No setup required on client side

🔧 Installation (Local Setup)

If you want to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kirshuu/multi-disease-app.git
cd multi-disease-app

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run app

🧪 Dummy Models for Demo

For deployment without real datasets, the file dummy_train_models.py generates synthetic demo models.

These models allow the app to:

run online

demonstrate UI + workflows

show XAI outputs

They are NOT medically accurate and are for academic/demo purposes only.

🛠 Future Enhancements

Integrate true LIME/SHAP explainability

Replace dummy models with real trained models

Deploy with secure authentication for clinicians

Integration with hospital EHR systems

Add support for additional diseases
